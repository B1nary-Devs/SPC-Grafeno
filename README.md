### The Challenge

The proposed challenge consists of exploring a diverse database containing historical information on financial assets, transactions, and market behaviors, using machine learning techniques to identify patterns and opportunities. The goal is to develop innovative financial products that add value to both the company and its clients. These products may predict trends, identify risks, or qualify financial assets. The solution must be presented as a proof of concept, justifying the techniques used, evaluating the performance of the models, and demonstrating the viability of the proposed product.

### The Solution
Based on the proposed challenge, a solution has been developed that will consist of a robust system with differentiated access control, allowing the management of different user profiles. The system will offer CRUD functionalities for Assignors and Drawees, enabling the complete management of these actors in the financial process. It will also allow the Administrator to view invoices, while Assignors will be able to view upcoming, overdue, and completed invoices, as well as information about Drawees. The system will include the visualization of Payment Locations for the Administrator, generate alerts for out-of-pattern activities, and provide monthly reconciliation reports, which will also contain forecasts based on historical data, optimizing the management and monitoring of financial operations.
